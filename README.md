# BIP-39 Mnemonic Generator - Pi Network Compatible

A web application that generates 24-word BIP-39 compliant mnemonic phrases that are fully compatible with Pi Network wallets, with bulk generation (up to 5000 at once) and multiple export options.

## Features

- 100% BIP-39 compliant implementation
- Uses the official 2048-word English wordlist
- Generates cryptographically secure entropy
- Includes proper checksum validation
- Simple web interface for easy use
- Fully compatible with Pi Network wallets
- Bulk generation of multiple mnemonics (up to 5000 at once)
- Multiple export options: Excel, CSV, and JSON
- Progress tracking for large generation tasks
- Preset count buttons for quick selection
- Deployed on Vercel's serverless platform

## Security Notice

⚠️ **Never share your mnemonic phrase with anyone!**  
This phrase is the only way to recover your wallet. Store it securely offline.

## Pi Network Compatibility

The mnemonic phrases generated by this tool are standard BIP-39 phrases and are fully compatible with Pi Network wallets. You can use them to:

- Create a new Pi wallet
- Import an existing Pi wallet
- Restore a Pi wallet on a new device

## Bulk Generation

The tool supports generating multiple mnemonics at once:

1. Enter the number of mnemonics you want to generate (1-5000)
2. Use preset buttons for quick selection (100, 500, 1000, 2000, 5000)
3. Click "Generate Bulk"
4. Monitor progress with the progress bar
5. View all generated mnemonics in the table
6. Export them using any of the export options

## Export Options

After generating mnemonics in bulk, you can export them in multiple formats:

### Excel Export
- Creates a formatted Excel spreadsheet (.xlsx)
- Includes an index number for each mnemonic
- Preserves formatting for easy reading

### CSV Export
- Creates a comma-separated values file (.csv)
- Compatible with spreadsheet applications
- Easy to import into databases

### JSON Export
- Creates a structured JSON file (.json)
- Includes metadata (count and generation timestamp)
- Easy to parse programmatically

## Performance Considerations

- Generating large numbers of mnemonics (1000+) may take some time
- The progress bar shows the generation status
- For very large numbers, the generation is processed in batches to prevent browser freezing
- Exporting to Excel for very large datasets (5000+) may take a few moments
